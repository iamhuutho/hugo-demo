### Computer Games
The greatest invention of the 20th century. But currently, I do not have time for them.  
Best ever played game: Final Fantasy VIII.

### Sport
I like soccer, martial art, swimming, inline skating. But, you know what, I'm not good at sport at all :)).  
Currently, I'm practicing badminton like crazy.

I occasionally tried to compose some so-called poems.
